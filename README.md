## ðŸ§  Recommendation Logic (baseline rules)

Thresholds (editable in config.py):

Hot: tmax â‰¥ 28Â°C â†’ tee, shorts/light pants, cap, water.

Warm: 22â€“27Â°C â†’ tee/shirt, jeans/pants, light shoes.

Cool: 15â€“21Â°C â†’ longâ€‘sleeve/light jacket, jeans, closed shoes.

Cold: â‰¤ 14Â°C â†’ sweater/hoodie + jacket, pants, warm shoes, beanie.

Precipitation: precip>0 â†’ umbrella/raincoat, waterproof shoes.

Wind: wind_ms>7 â†’ windbreaker/hood.

Algorithm:

From forecast derive temperature zone and flags (rain, wind, UV).

Map to seasonal sets + accessories.

Remove conflicting items, attach reasons.



## ðŸ”® ML Upgrade (roadmap)

Dataset: historical weather + user choices/ratings.

Features: tmin/tmax/feels, precip, wind, humidity, UV, weekday/holiday, city, user prefs.

Model: multiâ€‘label classification (Logistic/LightGBM) or learningâ€‘toâ€‘rank (pairwise).
